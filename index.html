  <h2>Oh, hello there. I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <p>
    I've spent the better part of the last 13 years gathering, cleaning, and transforming data to find meaning and to move organizations forward. I've worked for <a href = "https://planning.org/">non-profits</a>, <a href = "http://unitehere1.org">labor</a> <a href="http://www.seiu1.org">unions</a>, <a href="http://cookcountyclerk.com">governments</a>, and at least one <a href="http://luc.edu">university</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most days, I am writing SQL, building data pipelines, and modeling data. I find problems and I fix problems. Once the problems are fixed, I build reports to provide usable information to my colleagues.

    I was born and raised in Chicago, but I currently live in the northwest suburbs. I am married to an amazing and <a href="https://www.glorioustomato.com">talented</a>talented> woman named Jill.
